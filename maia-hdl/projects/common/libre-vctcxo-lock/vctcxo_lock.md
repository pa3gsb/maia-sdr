# vctcxo_lock register map

32-bit AXI-Lite, 8 word-registers at offsets `0x00`-`0x1C`. Base address
`0x43C00000` on the `libre` board (`ad_cpu_interconnect` call in
`boards/libre/vcxo_ctrl.tcl`).

This IP replaces `projects/common/antsdr-hdl/axi_vcxo_ctrl` on the
`libre` board only - `axi_vcxo_ctrl` is untouched and still used
elsewhere. Same external ports and base address (drop-in swap), but a
different internal architecture - see "Why a different architecture"
below before assuming any behavior carries over from the old register
map (`axi_vcxo_ctrl/vcxodac.md`).

| Offset | Name | R/W | Bits | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0x00` | reg0 (control) | R/W | `[0]` | `dac_mode`: 0 = loop-controlled DAC value (normal), 1 = force `dac_user_set_value` (manual/test) |
| | | | `[1]` | `dac_dither_dis`: 0 = dither enabled (default), 1 = disabled, plain truncation. Only meaningful for `DEVICE=DAC5311/DAC6311` (DAC7311 already gets the full 12-bit correction range). |
| | | | `[9:2]` | `p_shift` - proportional gain, centered at `128` = unity. Above 128 amplifies (left-shift), below attenuates (right-shift). Default `124` - see "Tuning p_shift/i_shift" below for the derivation (rescaled from the `ocpi.osp.libresdr` reference's `p_shift=4`, then empirically attenuated 4 bits further for this board's specific DAC7311/VCTCXO sensitivity). |
| | | | `[17:10]` | `i_shift` - integral gain, same centered-at-128 convention. Default `124` - re-tuned (see "Tuning p_shift/i_shift" below) after the sign fix and 1s measurement window; the earlier `108` derived alongside `p_shift` above turned out inert once the loop actually closed. |
| | | | `[31:18]` | unused |
| `0x04` | reg1 (manual setpoint / center) | R/W | `[15:0]` | `dac_user_set_value` - DAC code sent when `dac_mode=1` |
| | | | `[31:16]` | `center_dac` - DAC value the loop corrects around, and what it holds at when frozen (see "Freeze behavior" below). Default `0x2800` (10240) - **not** the `ocpi.osp.libresdr` reference's naive mid-scale default (`center_dac=2048` i.e. `0x8000` truncated for `DEVICE=DAC7311`). An earlier version of this port matched that reference default exactly; an open-loop DAC sweep on this board (see "The sign bug and the center_dac dead zone" below) found `0x8000` sits in a flat/saturated region of this specific VCTCXO's actual pulling curve, while `0x2800` - matching the value the earlier `b205_ref_pll.v` design had empirically swept to, for a different measurement architecture - is right where `freq_error` crosses zero. Re-sweep via `dac_mode=1`/`dac_user_set_value` if it doesn't converge cleanly on different hardware. |
| `0x08` | live DAC value | RO | `[15:0]` | The actual 16-bit setpoint currently driving the DAC (loop output or forced value) |
| `0x0C` | reg3 (ref select) | R/W | `[1:0]` | `dac_ref_sel`: `00`=CLKIN_10MHz, `01`=PPS_IN, `10`=PPS_GPS, `11`=none. Unlike the old design, this directly determines the measurement mode too (`00`->10 MHz counting, `01`/`10`->1PPS counting) - there's no auto-classification of what the selected signal looks like. **Default `00`** (auto-starts the loop on boot) - a deliberate, confirmed departure from the `ocpi.osp.libresdr` reference, which defaults `ref_source` to `none` (loop frozen until software explicitly enables it). This project has defaulted to auto-start since the original `b205_ref_pll.v` design and that convention was kept on purpose, unlike `p_shift`/`i_shift`/`center_dac` above, which are genuine numeric-fidelity fixes. |
| `0x10` | status | RO | `[0]` | `locked`: `ref_present` and the most recent measurement window's `|freq_error| <= lock_thresh`. Continuously re-evaluated against the latest completed window (1s period for the 10 MHz path - see "Measurement window" below), not a multi-window shift-register history like the old `ld`. |
| | | `[1]` | `ref_present`: reference edges are arriving (debounced by a saturating timeout counter, not reactive to a single missed edge). |
| | | `[31:2]` | unused |
| `0x14` | reg5 (lock threshold) | R/W | `[31:0]` | `lock_thresh` - compared against `|freq_error|` (raw edge-count units, see below) for the `locked` bit. Default `100`. **Untested starting point.** |
| `0x18` | live frequency error | RO | `[31:0]` | `freq_error` - signed, the most recent completed measurement window's edge-count error (negative = VCTCXO fast, positive = slow). Direct diagnostic readout - no bit-decoding needed, unlike the old design's status word. |
| `0x1C` | reserved | - | - | unused |

## Why a different architecture

The earlier antsdr-hdl-derived design (`b205_ref_pll.v`) measured the
VCTCXO's frequency using a sample clock that was itself `PLLE2_ADV`-
derived from the VCTCXO's own output - the measurement and the thing
being measured shared noise. That single decision was the root cause of
a long chain of bugs, found and fixed one at a time over an extended
debugging session: a chicken-and-egg bootstrap deadlock (the loop
couldn't validate the reference because its own clock was wrong,
because the loop hadn't corrected it yet), a long-window statistical
gate whose tolerance had to be loosened by >10x past its originally
intended value once the measurement's own noise floor was understood,
and a lock-detection threshold that could never sustain because it was
set below what the shared-clock measurement could actually resolve.

This IP is modeled on `ocpi.osp.libresdr`'s `vctcxo_lock.vhd`
(`ref-clk-support-2` branch, ported to Verilog), which avoids the whole
problem class structurally: `freq_meas.v` counts VCTCXO edges using
`s00_axi_aclk` - the Zynq PS's AXI clock (100 MHz on this board,
`sys_ps7/M_AXI_GP0_ACLK`, confirmed independent of the RF/VCTCXO clock
chain) - as the timebase, not a clock derived from the VCTCXO. There is
no PLL in this IP at all; `CLK_40MHz_FPGA` is brought in as a plain
2-FF-synchronized async input, exactly like the reference input pins.

This also gives a large precision improvement essentially for free:
counting VCTCXO edges directly, vs. the old architecture's
~1-part-in-20 single-period measurement that needed heavy statistical
averaging (and inherited shared-clock noise while doing it) to get
anywhere near useful precision.

### Measurement window

`freq_meas.v`'s `MEAS_CYCLES` parameter sets the 10 MHz path's window
length, and directly sets the measurement's quantization floor: each
`freq_error` count represents `1 / (CLK_HZ/10MHz * MEAS_CYCLES)` of the
VCTCXO's nominal frequency. This port originally instantiated
`MEAS_CYCLES=1_000_000` (a straight, faithful-port default) - a 100ms
window with only 4,000,000 expected edges, i.e. ~0.25 ppm/count. That's
coarse enough that the loop could report `locked` and hold a rock-steady
`dac_value` while still being 10-25 ppm off in reality (confirmed
against an external GSM `kalibrate` reading and SDR reception, both
before the sign fix below - see git history), simply because the
measurement couldn't see error below its own ~0.25 ppm quantization
step to begin with. Now instantiated at `MEAS_CYCLES=10_000_000` (a 1s
window, `EXP_10MHZ=40,000,000`), giving 0.025 ppm/count - the same
resolution as the PPS path - at the cost of a 10x slower correction
rate (once/second instead of once/100ms; acceptable, since this loop is
already tuned to be gentle over many windows regardless).

## Control law: PI instead of proportional + ad-hoc dead-band

The old design used a bare proportional term with a manually-tuned
dead-band to suppress small-signal chatter - a dead-band with no
hysteresis turned out to produce its own limit-cycle bounce whose
amplitude tracked the dead-band threshold directly, found by sweeping
`deadband_cycles` from 5 to 2000 and fast-polling the live DAC value.

`pi_ctrl.v` is a real PI controller (proportional + integral, both with
independently configurable gain) with hard output saturation and
conditional-integration anti-windup (a deliberate addition beyond the
`ocpi.osp.libresdr` reference - see the comment in `pi_ctrl.v`). No
dead-band is used or needed; integral control drives steady-state error
toward zero without needing a threshold to stop correcting.

`pi_ctrl.v` is a small multi-cycle pipeline (7 clk cycles from `valid`
to `valid_out`), not a single combinational cycle. The first version
computed the whole datapath - two 48-bit variable-shift barrel shifters,
several 48-bit adds, the anti-windup comparison, and saturation - all
combinationally in one clock edge. Real timing analysis found a failing
setup path (37 logic levels, ~12.4ns) from `i_acc_reg` through this
logic against the 10ns (100MHz) `s00_axi_aclk` period. There was no
reason to have optimized for single-cycle latency in the first place -
a new result is only needed once per completed measurement window (1s
= 100,000,000 clk cycles for the 10 MHz path, see "Measurement window"
above) - so the fix was to
spread the same arithmetic across a handful of pipeline stages, each
with a full clock period to settle, instead of hand-tuning logic depth.
`valid`/`valid_out` are still a single-cycle pulse interface at the
module boundary; only the internal latency changed.

## Freeze behavior (reference loss)

The old design forced `daco` back to a coarse bootstrap default the
instant the reference was judged lost, producing a real, physically
observable frequency glitch every single time - confirmed on hardware by
toggling the 10 MHz source off and back on and watching the live DAC
value jump.

This design instead **freezes** (holds the last correction, does not
reset to `center_dac`) whenever `dac_ref_sel` selects "none" or
`ref_present` goes low. Since `freq_meas.v` only produces a new
`error_valid` pulse once a full measurement window completes - which
requires the reference to still be present - a genuine reference loss
simply stops new corrections from arriving; the DAC output holds at
whatever it last was, rather than snapping to `center_dac`.

## Tuning `p_shift`/`i_shift`/`lock_thresh`

Defaults are chosen to match the `ocpi.osp.libresdr` reference's own
validated values (from `vctcxo_lock-hdl.xml`/`vctcxo_lock.rst`, fetched
after the first version of this port shipped with untested guesses -
see "the toggling-frequency incident" below): `p_shift=4`, `i_shift=20`,
`lock_thresh=100`, `center_dac=2048`. `lock_thresh` and `center_dac`
(see above) carry over directly, since they're in units (edge counts,
DAC-code mid-scale) that don't depend on this port's internal width
choices. `p_shift`/`i_shift` need rescaling first - see below - because
the reference's `pi_ctrl` is instantiated at `OUTPUT_W=12` (matching
DAC7311 exactly, no dither headroom), while this port keeps `OUTPUT_W=16`
to preserve dithering across DAC5311/DAC6311/DAC7311 (see "Dither"
below). 16 vs. 12 bits is a 4-bit/16x difference in what a given raw
correction number physically means, so reproducing the reference's
*actual* gain - not just copying its raw shift amounts - requires
subtracting 4 from each of their attenuation amounts before converting
to this port's centered-at-`SHIFT_MID` field encoding:

```
p_shift field = SHIFT_MID - (4  - 4) = 128 - 0  = 128  (unity)
i_shift field = SHIFT_MID - (20 - 4) = 128 - 16 = 112
```

**The toggling-frequency incident, in two parts:**

1. The first version of this port defaulted both `p_shift` and `i_shift`
   to `128` (unity, i.e. no rescaling applied at all) without the
   derivation above. `i_shift=128` gave the integrator essentially zero
   attenuation, against the reference's heavily-damped `1/2^20` - on
   real hardware this produced the correction saturating and swinging
   between extremes on nearly every measurement window, visible on a
   spectrum analyzer as two sharp, static peaks (a clean bang-bang
   toggle) rather than the loop converging.

2. After applying the rescaled values above (`p_shift=128`,
   `i_shift=112`) the *same* two-peak toggling persisted. Confirmed live
   (register write, no rebuild) that this board's specific DAC7311/
   VCTCXO pairing needs 4 more bits of attenuation than even the
   correctly-rescaled match to the reference's own gain: `p_shift=124`
   alone gave a fully static `dac_value` (90/90 one-second samples, no
   movement at all); shifting `i_shift` by the same 4 bits (`108`) to
   preserve the reference's relative P/I balance was equally stable.
   This mirrors a finding from the earlier `b205_ref_pll.v` design on
   this same hardware, which also needed markedly gentler correction
   than theory (there, the antsdr-hdl reference design's own
   assumptions) predicted. **This turned out to be a red herring** - see
   "The sign bug and the center_dac dead zone" below: `p_shift=124`/
   `i_shift=108` looking "stable" here was really the integrator being
   inert under a sign bug, not correct convergence.

3. After the sign fix and `center_dac` correction (see below) and
   widening the measurement window to 1s (see "Measurement window"
   above), `p_shift=124`/`i_shift=108` was re-tested and found genuinely
   inert this time too - at the 1s window rate, `i_shift=108`'s
   `1/2^20`-equivalent attenuation needs on the order of tens of minutes
   to move the DAC by one code. Jumping straight to `i_shift=128` (full
   unity - a 256x gain increase from `120`, not the small step it looks
   like) caused a genuine accumulator runaway: `dac_value` jumped ~33,000
   codes into a saturated region in a single window, `freq_error` pinned
   at a large value, `locked` dropped, and the board needed a reboot to
   recover (the accumulator was stuck saturated with `error`'s sign
   matching its own, so anti-windup's sign-flip snap never triggered -
   error was flat in that saturated DAC region, so it never got the
   chance to flip). Stepping more carefully, `i_shift=124` (one step
   down from the runaway value, not `128`) converges cleanly: from a
   fresh boot, `freq_error` walks from around -27 counts to within a few
   counts of 0 over about 2 minutes, no overshoot, `dac_value` ramp
   smooth throughout. **Current defaults: `p_shift=124`, `i_shift=124`.**
   If retuning `i_shift` again, step gradually (a few field values at a
   time) rather than jumping to unity - the gain difference across the
   field's range is exponential, not linear, and a step that looks small
   in field-value terms can be a large multiple in actual gain.

If you ever see that same two-peak signature again after changing
`p_shift`/`i_shift`, suspect the gain being too aggressive first -
specifically the integral term, since a bare proportional error that's
merely a bit too strong tends to overshoot and ring, while an
under-damped integrator tends to produce this cleaner, more sustained
bang-bang toggle. If instead you see a large, sudden jump followed by a
frozen `dac_value` and `locked` dropping, suspect accumulator runaway
(item 3 above) - recover with a reboot, not more register writes, since
a saturated accumulator in a flat DAC region won't self-correct.

## Absolute accuracy is bounded by the external reference, not this loop

Once the sign bug, `center_dac` dead zone, and measurement window were
all fixed, `freq_error` converges to within a fraction of a ppm of
`CLKIN_10MHz` and holds there (modulo real environmental/thermal drift
the loop continues to track). Despite that, external verification (GSM
`kalibrate`, using this same board as the receiver) kept reading a
roughly constant ~2.5-2.8 ppm offset throughout - essentially unchanged
across a >5x improvement in the loop's own internal convergence. That
invariance is the signature of an error source outside the loop
entirely: the loop can only be as accurate as the reference it's given.
In this case `CLKIN_10MHz` was fed from a bench signal generator (R&S
SME03) whose standard (non-OCXO) internal reference is typically spec'd
around ~1 ppm, worse with aging/calibration drift - fully consistent
with the observed residual. The LibreSDR's VCTCXO itself is spec'd at
0.5 ppm free-running accuracy (see the board datasheet), which is
*tighter* than a mediocre external reference - disciplining to a worse
reference than the VCTCXO's own factory trim makes real-world accuracy
worse, not better. Before chasing further loop precision, verify
whatever is driving `CLKIN_10MHz` (or `PPS_IN`/`PPS_GPS`) is actually
more accurate than 0.5 ppm; if it isn't, leaving `dac_ref_sel=11` (none,
loop frozen/VCTCXO free-running) may outperform disciplining to it.

Approximate ppm-per-count, for context when picking `lock_thresh` (see
"Measurement window" above for the 10 MHz path's history - this used to
be 10x coarser than the PPS path, no longer):
- 10 MHz path (`dac_ref_sel=00`): 1 count ≈ 0.025 ppm (`error_out` is
  edges over a `CLK_HZ/10MHz * MEAS_CYCLES` = 40,000,000-edge nominal
  window)
- PPS path (`dac_ref_sel=01` or `10`): 1 count ≈ 0.025 ppm (nominal
  window is `CLK_HZ` = 40,000,000 edges) - same resolution as the 10 MHz
  path now.

Expect to need the same empirical, fast-poll-based tuning pass that
`gain_shift`/`deadband_cycles` went through in the old design - see that
history in `axi_vcxo_ctrl/vcxodac.md` for the methodology (poll `0x18`/
`0x08` in a tight loop with no `sleep`, over tens of seconds to minutes,
not a quick glance - a short poll gave a misleadingly clean result more
than once during that process).

Read-modify-write example (libre board base `0x43C00000`, set
`p_shift` to amplify by `<<<2` from unity, preserving other reg0
fields):
```
devmem2 0x43C00000 w $(( ($(devmem2 0x43C00000 w | tail -1) & ~(0xFF << 2)) | (130 << 2) ))
```

## The sign bug and the center_dac dead zone

After the toggling incident above was fixed (gains attenuated) and
`center_dac` was changed to match the reference's naive mid-scale
(`0x8000`), the loop reported `locked=1` with a small, rock-steady
`freq_error` - but external verification (GSM `kalibrate`, SDR
reception at a known frequency) showed real errors of 10-25 ppm, far
outside what the loop believed. Diagnosis, in order:

1. **The integrator was inert, not converged.** At `i_shift=108`
   (`1/2^20` net attenuation given the `OUTPUT_W` rescaling), the
   accumulator needed on the order of 25,000 windows (~42 minutes at
   the old 100ms window) to move the DAC by even one code. A
   short/moderate fast-poll test correctly showed "no oscillation" but
   was mistaken for "converged" - it was actually just too slow to see
   any movement at all. Raising `i_shift` (e.g. to `120`) made the
   integrator visibly active again (`dac_value` ramping monotonically).

2. **`center_dac=0x8000` sits in a flat/saturated region of this
   board's actual VCTCXO pulling curve.** With the integrator now
   visibly ramping, `freq_error` still wasn't shrinking despite
   hundreds of DAC codes of movement. An open-loop sweep (`dac_mode=1`,
   PI controller output disconnected from the DAC entirely, so no loop
   dynamics or sign convention could confound the result) stepped
   `dac_user_set_value` from `0x1000` to `0x9100` and read `freq_error`
   at each point. Result: `freq_error` is flat/insensitive to `dac`
   above roughly `0x7000` (e.g. `0x8300` and `0x9100` - a huge span -
   both read the same error), but clearly monotonic and sensitive
   between `0x1000` and `0x4000`, crossing zero almost exactly at
   `0x2800`. This matches the value `b205_ref_pll.v` had empirically
   swept to on this same board, for what had looked like unrelated
   reasons at the time.

3. **The sign of `correction` relative to `center_dac` was backwards
   for this board.** The same open-loop sweep is unambiguous ground
   truth for the sign of `dErr/dDac`: it's *positive* on this hardware
   (`freq_error` increases as `dac` increases) across the whole usable
   range. `pi_ctrl.v` computes `correction` with the same sign as
   `error_in` (a faithful port of the reference, which assumes the
   opposite polarity on its own hardware), and `vctcxo_lock_v1_0.v` was
   computing `dac_raw = center_dac + correction` - positive feedback
   given this board's actual polarity, not negative feedback. This is
   consistent with everything observed: it explains the original
   two-peak toggling as a classic positive-feedback-plus-saturation
   limit cycle rather than ordinary overshoot, and it explains a
   closed-loop capture (post item 1's fix, pre this fix) where
   `dac_value` walked steadily *away* from the known-good `0x2800`
   zero-crossing while `freq_error` stayed pinned instead of shrinking.
   **Fixed** by flipping the sign at the board-integration boundary -
   `dac_raw = center_dac - correction` in `vctcxo_lock_v1_0.v`, not
   inside `pi_ctrl.v` (whose anti-windup logic keys off the sign of the
   accumulator vs. error internally; the polarity flip belongs where
   the board-specific fact lives, not inside the faithfully-ported
   control law).

`center_dac` was reverted to `0x2800` as part of the same fix (see the
register table above). Confirmed on hardware after rebuild: fresh boot
converges to `freq_error` within a few counts of zero and holds it
there indefinitely, with `dac_value` static (not drifting in either
direction) - the signature of genuine negative-feedback convergence,
not a saturated dead zone or positive-feedback runaway. `p_shift`/
`i_shift` were characterized (steps 1-2 above) before this sign fix, in
the `0x8000` dead zone - they are unvalidated again and were only kept
as a conservative (non-oscillating) starting point; re-tune against the
now-closed loop if the correction rate needs to be faster than what
`i_shift=108`/1s windows give.

## Dither

Same design as the old `b205_ref_pll.v`: below the DAC's native
resolution (8/10/12 bits for DAC5311/DAC6311/DAC7311), a first-order
delta-sigma accumulator toggles the transmitted code between two
adjacent DAC codes with a duty cycle proportional to the discarded
fraction. The dither tick rate is now ~24.4 kHz (100 MHz `clk` / 4096)
instead of the old design's ~48.8 kHz (200 MHz / 4096) - still well
above typical tune-line RC filter corner frequencies, but worth knowing
if retuning the divider ever comes up.

## DAC SPI driver

`dacxx11_spi.v` is a self-contained copy of the already-fixed
DAC5311/DAC6311/DAC7311 driver from
`projects/common/antsdr-hdl/axi_vcxo_ctrl/src/dacxx11_spi.v` (the 16-bit
SPI frame width bug found and fixed earlier this project - `{mode, data,
2'b00}`, not a bare `{mode, data}` that silently zero-extends on the
wrong side). Kept as an independent copy per this IP living outside
`antsdr-hdl`, not a reference to that directory.
